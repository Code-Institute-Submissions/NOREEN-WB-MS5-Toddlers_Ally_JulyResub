# Toddler's Ally
## Introduction

The live link can be found here - (https://toddlers-ally.herokuapp.com/)

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for Toddlers and Kidd's. Users will be able to purchase their toddler or kids daily usefull and helpful products from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also have the ability to use all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
