# Toddler's Ally
## Introduction

The live link can be found here - (https://toddlers-ally.herokuapp.com/)

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for Toddlers and Kidd's. Users will be able to purchase their toddler or kids daily usefull and helpful products from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also have the ability to use all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

 ### User Stories

 Throughout the project, I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep the focus on the necessary tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed. I would add new user stories during the project to keep track of the tasks that had to be done.
