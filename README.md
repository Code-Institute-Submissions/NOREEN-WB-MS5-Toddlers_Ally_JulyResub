# Toddler's Ally
## Introduction

The live link can be found here - (https://toddlers-ally.herokuapp.com/)

Welcome to my fifth project. This project is an e-commerce store for Toddlers and Kidd's. Users will be able to purchase their toddler or kids daily usefull and helpful products from this website. This project will use languages and frameworks such as Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide access to the site's data for users to purchase a range of products.

The admin of the website will also have the ability to use all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

 ### User Stories

 Throughout the project, I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep the focus on the necessary tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed. I would add new user stories during the project to keep track of the tasks that had to be done.

# 4. Testing
 [Go to top](#table-of-contents)

 ### Manual Checking
 
 While developing the app i have tested each and every page, url and view. I was also pylint in my editor since most the is in python. pylint gives me red or yellow lines according to the error which i solved while developing.

 During learing the course instructor told that django is MVT. If you want to create something you have to follow this procedure. So this technique help me alot to keep checking the flow. 

 On the other hand Oline tools Were also to check the code. for example in order to check html W3C was used. In order to check CSS Jigsaw was used to check PEP8 was along with pylint which was already installed in my editor.

 ## W3C
 W3C didin't help much in Check the code since python django synatxt is there.

 ## Jigsaw
 Jigsaw was used to check the css the error if there were any.

 ![Add-Category](documentation/images/css-check.JPG)

 ### JavaScript:
I used [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) to check for any errors within all my JavaScript script files. JS Hint showed warnings a few warnings but no errors.

I had no errors in my JavaScript files:

2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code edito using the clone link.
3. Enter "python3 manage.py runserver into the terminal.
4. Go to localhost address on my web browser.
5. All locally saved changes will show up here.

For the final deployment to Heroku, I had to:

1. Create Heroku App

5. Back up the local database using "./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json" in the terminal window.
6. Comment out the local default database
7. Add the Heroku database url via dj_database_url.parse()
8. Run migrations to the Postgres database
9. Restore the database using this command "./manage.py loaddata db.json" in the terminal windows.
10. Create a SuperUser for the Postgres database
11. Configure the database so that when the app is running on Heroku it uses the Postgres database and when it's running locally it uses the SQLite database
12. Create Procfile so that Heroku creates a web dyno so that it will run gunicorn and serve the Django app
13. Disable Heroku collect static
14. Add the Heroku hostname to allowed hosts in settings.py

26. Add AWS keys to the Heroku config variables
27. Create custom storage classes for media and static files
28. In settings.py add a statement to use the static and media storage class and locations
29. Commit and push to GitHub and Heroku
30. In the S3 bucket create a new folder for media
31. Upload all used images to the media file in the S3 bucket
32. Add the Stripe keys to the Heroku config variables
